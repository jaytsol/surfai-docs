# Coin Consumption Workflow (Improved Atomicity)

ðŸ’° Coin Consumption Workflow: Using Workflows (Improved Atomicity)
Last Updated: July 22, 2025

This document describes an improved flow that ensures data consistency by bundling coin deduction and generation record saving into a single database transaction when a user generates an image or video using a workflow.

---

## 1. Overview

To resolve data inconsistency issues that can arise when coin deduction and generation record saving are handled as separate transactions in the existing workflow, these two operations are now bundled into a single database transaction. This ensures atomicity, meaning both coin deduction and generation record saving either succeed together or both fail and are rolled back.

    participant WorkflowService as WorkflowService
    participant CoinService as CoinService

    User->>Frontend: Image/Video Generation Request
    Frontend->>GeneratedOutputService: Call create(createDTO)
    
    activate GeneratedOutputService
    note right of GeneratedOutputService: 1. Retrieve Workflow Cost
    GeneratedOutputService->>WorkflowService: getWorkflowCost(sourceWorkflowId)
    activate WorkflowService
    WorkflowService->>DB: Query Workflow Entity (including cost)
    activate DB
    DB-->>WorkflowService: Return Workflow Entity
    deactivate DB
    WorkflowService-->>GeneratedOutputService: Return cost
    deactivate WorkflowService

    note right of GeneratedOutputService: 2. Start Single DB Transaction
    GeneratedOutputService->>DB: createQueryRunner().connect().startTransaction()
    activate DB

    GeneratedOutputService->>CoinService: deductCoins(userId, cost, IMAGE_GENERATION, queryRunner)
    activate CoinService
    CoinService->>DB: Check and Deduct User Coin Balance, Record CoinTransaction (DEDUCT) (within the same transaction)
    DB-->>CoinService: Return Transaction Result
    deactivate CoinService

    alt Coin Deduction Success
        GeneratedOutputService->>DB: Save GeneratedOutput Entity (within the same transaction)
        DB-->>GeneratedOutputService: Save Success (return savedOutput)
        
        note right of GeneratedOutputService: 3. Commit Transaction
        GeneratedOutputService->>DB: commitTransaction()
    else Coin Deduction Failed or GeneratedOutput Save Failed
        note right of GeneratedOutputService: 3. Rollback Transaction
        GeneratedOutputService->>DB: rollbackTransaction()
    end
    deactivate DB
    deactivate GeneratedOutputService
```

## 3. Key Improvements

*   **Ensured Atomicity:** Coin deduction (`deductCoins`) and saving generated results (`outputRepository.save`) are bundled into a single database transaction within `GeneratedOutputService` using `QueryRunner`. This prevents data inconsistency by rolling back the entire transaction if either operation fails.
*   **Data Consistency:** Eliminates the possibility of coins being deducted but results not being saved, or vice versa, significantly improving the system's data consistency.
*   **Refund Logic Removal (Success Path):** Since transactions are handled atomically, a separate refund logic (`addCoins`) is no longer needed if saving the generation record fails after coin deduction. Transaction rollback is sufficient. (However, exceptions occurring within `deductCoins` itself may still need to be handled.)

---

## 4. Implementation Considerations

*   **`CoinService.deductCoins` Modification:** The `deductCoins` method must be modified to accept an externally passed `QueryRunner` to participate in the transaction.
*   **`GeneratedOutputService.create` Modification:** The logic must be changed to create a `QueryRunner` and use it when calling `deductCoins` and `outputRepository.save`. Ensure `commitTransaction` or `rollbackTransaction` is called within a `try-catch` block.
